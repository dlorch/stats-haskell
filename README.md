# Statistics and Haskell Playground

Teaching myself [statistics](https://www.mathsisfun.com/definitions/statistics.html) and [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) at the same time.

Loosely based on the excellent book [Think Stats 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-stats-2e/) by Allen B. Downey.

## Examples
